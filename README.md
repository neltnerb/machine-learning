Machine Learning for Chemistry

This is my starting github repository for using TensorFlow in order to perform machine learning for computational chemistry.

So far, this is quite bare, with only two examples. Of these, the chemistry example actually gets some reasonable results while the protein example does not produce useful results (yet).
