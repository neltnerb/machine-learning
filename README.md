# Machine Learning for Chemistry

This is my starting github repository for using TensorFlow in order to perform machine learning for computational chemistry.

So far, this is quite bare.

## Chemistry Example

This example is based on the work of Steven Kearnes, *et al.* in [Molecular graph convolutions: moving beyond fingerprints](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10822-016-9938-8). In it, I create a dataset of the solubility of approximately 1000 chemicals in the same format that they used in identifying molecular features, and trained it briefly using a deep neural network and TensorFlow. The results are shown in Figure_1.png and while they are not nearly as good as Kearnes' model it was useful as a first project.
